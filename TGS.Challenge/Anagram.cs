  /*
        Devise a function that checks if 1 word is an anagram of another, if the words are anagrams of
        one another return true, else return false

        "Anagram": An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or
        phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; for example
        orchestra can be rearranged into carthorse.

        areAnagrams("horse", "shore") should return true
        areAnagrams("horse", "short") should return false

        NOTE: Punctuation, including spaces should be ignored, e.g.

        horse!! shore = true
        horse  !! shore = true
          horse? heroes = true

        There are accompanying unit tests for this exercise, ensure all tests pass & make
        sure the unit tests are correct too.
